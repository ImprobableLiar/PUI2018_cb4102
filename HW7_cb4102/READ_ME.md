## HW 7 Submission

#### Academic Disclaimer: I worked with Sam Manzi and Eve Marenghi on this assignment. We work independently but help each other for checking work and answers and for troubleshooting errors in code.

#### Assignment overview:

#### The purpose of this assignment was to gain experience wrangling data from the AFF and Census and work with geopandas to structure and analyze geospatial data. This was also the first assignment we got experience designing our own maps.
