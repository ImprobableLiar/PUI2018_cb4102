### Figure 1: Distribution of Late Buses in Toronto by Number of Minutes, April 2018

#### Source: Open Data Toronto, Toronto Transit Commission, April 2018. 
#### Data can be found here: https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/transportation/#bb967f18-8d90-defc-2946-db3543648bd6

#### Explanation For my graph I analyzed the distribution of late buses in Toronto, based on data from Open Data Toronto from April 2018. The data has a mean of 11.7 minutes but a large standard deviation of 8.5 minutes (particularly considering the left tail is constrained to be above 0). I also added the cumulative distribution function for additional context about the underlying distribution. The CDF shows us that about 80% of all buses are late by less than 20 minutes.
