 a) Null and Alternative Hypothesis
 
 The idea chosen is that men are more likely than women to start trips between the
 hours of 8 PM and 4 AM. I think based on this idea the null hypothesis can be better
 formulated to compare the proportion of men and women starting trips in these hours.
 Similar for the alternative hypothesis.

 b) Data Processing
 
 The data has the appropriate features which are start time and
 gender to answer the question. The data has been pre-processed by creating two
 dataframes for men and women that contain the hour for the start time and a flag
 indicating if it was within the hours of 8:00 PM to 4:00 AM.

 c) Comments
 
 Interesting hypothesis has been chosen and efficient data processing has been done
 to support hypothesis testing.

 d) Statistical Test
 
 I think ANOVA  is the most appropriate test to use here. It is used to answer the
 question whether differences exist between two groups on one DV. The two groups here
 are men and women starting trips between the hours of 8 PM and 4 AM.
