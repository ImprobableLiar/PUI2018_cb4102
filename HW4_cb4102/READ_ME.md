# Read Me for PUI HW4

### Academic Disclaimer: I worked with Sam Manzi (sm4372) on assignment 3 and for the portion of assignment 2 where you had to read the csv in and unzip it in PUIdata

#### The scope of the homework was to begin working with distributions and to reinforce:

##### Central Limit Theorum: That the means taken from samples of any distribution (poisson, normal, binomial, etc.) will converge to a normal distribution

##### Law of large numbers: As the size of the sample increases, we observe converge to the expected mean

##### hypothesis testing / z-scores: We learned about stating and testing null and alternative hypothesis using z-scores

#### Some data processing that was introduced included:

##### learning how to read in a csv and unzip it using bash/system commands

##### Some basic matplotlib plotting was introduced (scatter plots, histograms)
